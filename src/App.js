          <p>Have you ever heard of the Gloms?</p>
         
          <p>You probably haven't got much of a clue about the Gloms.<br /> To be fair, the Gloms haven't got much of a clue about the Gloms either.<br />
          You may be wondering, how that's even plausible.</p>
         
          <p>The Gloms are an arguably smart alien race, just like us, the Humans.<br />
          However, it seems we Humans got better and better over time at reminding ourselves what it means to be Humans
          and that's how school subjects like Biology or History were born.</p>

          <p>The Gloms have what in human terms we'd call the memory of a goldfish.<br />
          It'd be hard to find out whether there have ever been attempts at keeping records of historical Glom endeavours because there would be no records of such attempts in the first place.</p> 

          <p>Then what is it that makes a Glom a Glom? Let curiosity lead your way.</p>

              It's quite hard to determine when the Gloms are talking about a specific Glom and when they are referring to The Glom.</p>
              <p>However, their brain has tiny compartments to store things which are absolutely secret and should not be broadcasted, like for instance their private keys.</p>
              <p>Current questions the Gloms are wrapping their collective knowledge pool around:<br />
              When did I start?<br />
              Where did I start?<br />
              Is this Glomy jello or Glomy snot?<br />
              </p>              
              <p>The Gloms also have at least 27 recognised genders and new ones are always popping up.</p>
